# ASG2 WEBSITE API
This project is a movie website that will display the latest movies through an api from a movie database. In certain sections of the website it will display the top rated and upcoming movies in an image carousel. Upon clicking one of the movies it will display the movie information like description, director, release date, etc.

---DESIGN PROCESS---
As the user, I would want to find the latest movies to watch. So I put the list of movies near the top of the front page.

---FEATURES---
1) Display popular/top rated movie titles - In the main page, the api is able to retrieve popular and upcoming movies from the database

---FEATURES TO BE ADDED---
1) Bookmarks - user is able to add a movie to bookmarks, by which the movie is saved to a bookmark list in case they want to return to check the movie information 
2) Similar movies - In the single.html page where a specific movie is selected, there will be another carousel of movies that are from the same genre to recommend to the user.
3) News page - Another page that can retrieve news articles about movies.
4) Upon clicking on a movie, user will be redirected to a page that displays information about the movie like description, ratings, reviews and posters.
