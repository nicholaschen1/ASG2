# ASG2 WEBSITE API
This project is a movie website that will display the latest movies through an api from a movie database. In certain sections of the website it will display the top rated and upcoming movies in an image carousel. Upon clicking one of the movies it will display the movie information like description, director, release date, etc.

---DESIGN PROCESS---
As the user, I would want to find the latest movies to watch. So I put the list of popular movies that are showing now near the top of the front page and top rated movies right below. I used an image carousel so that the website will not look so static and plain. 

---FEATURES---
1) Display popular/top rated movie titles - In the main page, the api is able to retrieve popular and upcoming movies from the database
2) Upon clicking one of the movies, the user will be brought into another page where the respective movie information like title, date, and ratings are shown.

---FEATURES TO BE ADDED---
1) Bookmarks - user is able to add a movie to bookmarks, by which the movie is saved to a bookmark list in case they want to return to check the movie information 
2) Similar movies - In the single.html page where a specific movie is selected, there will be another carousel of movies that are from the same genre to recommend to the user.
3) News page - Another page that can retrieve news articles about movies.
4) Book a movie - In the movie information page, a button called "book" will redirect the user to another website that is able to book the respective movie.
